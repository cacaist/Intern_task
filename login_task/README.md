# Login Task 🎄

Hi! This is the login project I built with React for my internship task. I wanted to make it festive, so I added a christmas theme with some cool animations! ❄️

##  What's inside?

* **Responsive Login UI:** Card-based login form with a holiday gradient background.
* **Input Validation:**
    * Checks if fields are empty ("Maybe you should type something first?").
    * Validates email format ("Are you sure that's an email?").
    * Enforces a minimum password length of 6 characters ("Dont be lazy...").
* **Dynamic Animations:**
    * Falling **Snowflakes** generated via JavaScript & CSS ❄️.
    * Floating **Fire** animation on the welcome screen 🔥.
* **Routing:** Uses `react-router-dom` to navigate from Login to the Welcome page.
* **State Management:** Passes the user's email to the Welcome screen to display a personalized "Happy New Year" message.

##  Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React (v19)️
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Routing:** React Router DOM (v7)
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Animations, Keyframes, Gradients)
